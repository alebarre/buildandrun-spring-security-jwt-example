# Spring application with JWT authentication flux

## Overview
This Spring Boot application demonstrates how to implement JWT authentication in a reactive environment using Spring WebFlux. The project is designed to offer secure REST APIs with token-based authentication while leveraging the non-blocking, event-driven architecture provided by WebFlux.

## Features
- **Reactive Programming:** Built with Spring WebFlux for non-blocking, asynchronous processing.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
- **RESTful API:** Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for various resources.
- **Error Handling:** Centralized exception management and reactive error responses.
- **Extensibility:** Easily integrate additional modules or services as needed.

## Prerequisites
- **Java:** JDK 17 or higher
- **Docker** open /docker folder end run "docker compose up" to build the MySql database structure.
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Database:** (Optional) Any relational or NoSQL database (configuration available in `application.properties` or `application.yml`)
